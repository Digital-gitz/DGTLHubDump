ABOUT_SWITCH


Short description

Explains how to use a switch to handle multiple conditional statements.


Long description

To check a condition in a script or function, you can use an if statement.
The if statement can check many types of conditions, including the value of
variables and the properties of objects.

To check multiple conditions, you can use a switch statement. The switch
statement is similar to a series of if statements, but it's simpler. The
switch statement lists each condition and an optional action. If a
condition matches, the action is performed.

The switch statement can use the $_ and $switch automatic variables. For
more information, see about_Automatic_Variables.


Syntax

A basic switch statement has the following format:

    switch (<test-expression>) {
        <result1-to-be-matched> {<action>}
        <result2-to-be-matched> {<action>}
    }

This is similar to the following if statements:

    if (<result1-to-be-matched> -eq (<test-expression>)) {<action>}
    if (<result2-to-be-matched> -eq (<test-expression>)) {<action>}

The <test-expression> is single expression that's evaluated in expression
mode to return a value.

The <result-to-be-matched> is an expression whose value is compared to the
input value. Expressions include literal values (strings or numbers),
variables, and scriptblocks that return a boolean value. For an example,
see Impact of string conversion later in this article.

It's important to understand that the <result-to-be-matched> value is on
the left-hand side of the comparison expression. That means the result of
the <test-expression> is on the right-hand side, which can be converted to
the type of the left-hand side value for comparison. For more information,
see about_Comparison_Operators

The value default is reserved for the action used when there are no other
matches.

The $_ automatic variable contains the value of the expression passed to
the switch statement and is available for evaluation and use within the
scope of the <result-to-be-matched> statements.

The complete switch statement syntax is as follows:

    switch [-Regex | -Wildcard | -Exact] [-CaseSensitive] (<test-expression>) {
        string | number | variable | { <value-scriptblock> }
            { <action-scriptblock> }
        default { <action-scriptblock> } # optional
    }

or

    switch [-Regex | -Wildcard | -Exact] [-CaseSensitive] -File filename {
        string | number | variable | { <value-scriptblock> }
            { <action-scriptblock> }
        default { <action-scriptblock> }  # optional
    }

If you don't use parameters, switch behaves the same as using the EXACT
parameter. It performs a case-insensitive match for the value. If the value
is a collection, each element is evaluated in the order in which it
appears.

The switch statement must include at least one condition statement.

The default clause is triggered when the value doesn't match any of the
conditions. It's equivalent to an else clause in an if statement. Only one
default clause is permitted in each switch statement.

switch has the following parameters:

-   WILDCARD - Indicates that the condition is a wildcard string. If the
    match clause isn't a string, the parameter is ignored. The comparison
    is case-insensitive.
-   EXACT - Indicates that the match clause, if it's a string, must match
    exactly. If the match clause isn't a string, this parameter is ignored.
    The comparison is case-insensitive.
-   CASESENSITIVE - Performs a case-sensitive match. If the match clause is
    not a string, this parameter is ignored.
-   FILE - Takes input from a file rather than a <test-expression>. The
    file is read a line at a time and evaluated by the switch statement. By
    default, the comparison is case-insensitive. The FILE parameter only
    supports one file. If multiple FILE parameters are included, only the
    last one is used. For more information see File parameter examples.
-   REGEX - Performs regular expression matching of the value to the
    condition. If the match clause isn't a string, this parameter is
    ignored. The comparison is case-insensitive. The $Matches automatic
    variable is available for use within the matching statement block.

  [!NOTE] When specifying conflicting values, like REGEX and WILDCARD, the
  last parameter specified takes precedence, and all conflicting parameters
  are ignored. Multiple instances of parameters are also permitted.
  However, only the last parameter listed is used.


Simple match examples

In the following example, the switch statement compares the test value 3 to
each of the conditions. When the test value matches the condition, the
action is performed.

    switch (3) {
        1 { "It's one."   }
        2 { "It's two."   }
        3 { "It's three." }
        4 { "It's four."  }
    }

    It's three.

In this example, the value is compared to each condition in the list. The
following switch statement has two conditions for a value of 3, which
demonstrates that all conditions are tested.

    switch (3) {
        1 { "It's one."    }
        2 { "It's two."    }
        3 { "It's three."  }
        4 { "It's four."   }
        3 { "Three again." }
    }

    It's three.
    Three again.

To direct the switch to stop comparing after a match, use the break
statement. The break statement terminates the switch statement.

    switch (3) {
        1 { "It's one."           }
        2 { "It's two."           }
        3 { "It's three."; break  }
        4 { "It's four."          }
        3 { "Three again."        }
    }

    It's three.

If the test value is a collection, such as an array, each item in the
collection is evaluated in the order in which it appears. The following
examples evaluates 4 and then 2.

    switch (4, 2) {
        1 { "It's one."    }
        2 { "It's two."    }
        3 { "It's three."  }
        4 { "It's four."   }
        3 { "Three again." }
    }

    It's four.
    It's two.

Any break statements apply to the collection, not to each value, as shown
in the following example. The switch statement is terminated by the break
statement in the condition of value 4.

    switch (4, 2) {
        1 { "It's one.";    break }
        2 { "It's two." ;   break }
        3 { "It's three." ; break }
        4 { "It's four." ;  break }
        3 { "Three again."        }
    }

    It's four.


Impact of string conversion

Any unquoted value that's not recognized as a number is treated as a
string. To avoid unintended string conversion, use script blocks to
evaluate the switch value.

    switch ( ([datetime]'1 Jan 1970').DayOfWeek ) {
        4            { 'The value matches a Thursday.' }
        "4"          { 'The numeric string matches a Thursday.' }
        "Thursday"   { 'The string value matches a Thursday.' }
        { 4 -eq $_ } { 'The expression matches a Thursday.' }
    }

The DAYOFWEEK property of the date object is an enumeration. While
enumerations can be compared to their numeric or string values, the switch
statement converts the value to a the string representation of the
enumeration.

    The string value matches a Thursday.
    The expression matches a Thursday.

This behavior is different from the behavior of the -eq comparison in an if
statement.

    if (4 -eq ([datetime]'1 Jan 1970').DayOfWeek) {
        'The value matches a Thursday.'
    }

    The value matches a Thursday.


More complex match examples

In this example, the switch statement is testing for the type of the value
in the hashtable. You must use and expression that returns a boolean value
to select the scriptblock to execute.

    $var = @{A = 10; B = 'abc'}

    foreach ($key in $var.Keys) {
        switch ($var[$key].GetType()) {
            { $_ -eq [int32]  }  { "$key + 10 = $($var[$key] + 10)" }
            { $_ -eq [string] }  { "$key = $($var[$key])"           }
        }
    }

    A + 10 = 20
    B = abc

In this example, an object that's not a string or numerical data is passed
to the switch. The switch performs a string coercion on the object and
evaluates the outcome.

    $test = @{
        Test  = 'test'
        Test2 = 'test2'
    }

    $test.ToString()

    switch -Exact ($test) {
        'System.Collections.Hashtable' { 'Hashtable string coercion' }
        'test'                         { 'Hashtable value' }
    }

    System.Collections.Hashtable
    Hashtable string coercion

In this example, there is no matching case so there is no output.

    switch ("fourteen") {
        1     { "It's one.";   break }
        2     { "It's two.";   break }
        3     { "It's three."; break }
        4     { "It's four.";  break }
        "fo*" { "That's too many."   }
    }

By adding the default clause, you can perform an action when no other
conditions succeed.

    switch ("fourteen") {
        1       { "It's one.";   break }
        2       { "It's two.";   break }
        3       { "It's three."; break }
        4       { "It's four.";  break }
        "fo*"   { "That's too many."   }
        default { "No matches"         }
    }

    No matches

For the word fourteen to match a case you must use the -Wildcard or -Regex
parameter.

    switch -Wildcard ("fourteen") {
        1     { "It's one.";   break }
        2     { "It's two.";   break }
        3     { "It's three."; break }
        4     { "It's four.";  break }
        "fo*" { "That's too many."   }
    }

    That's too many.

The following example uses the -Regex parameter.

    $target = 'https://bing.com'
    switch -Regex ($target) {
        '^ftp\://.*$'
            {
                "$_ is an ftp address"
                break
            }
        '^\w+@\w+\.com|edu|org$'
            {
                "$_ is an email address"
                break
            }
        '^(http[s]?)\://.*$'
            {
                "$_ is a web address that uses $($Matches[1])"
                break
            }
    }

    https://bing.com is a web address that uses https

The following example demonstrates the use of script blocks as switch
statement conditions.

    switch ("Test") {
        { $_ -is [string] } { "Found a string" }
        "Test"              { "This $_ executes as well" }
    }

    Found a string
    This Test executes as well

The following example processes an array containing two date values. The
<value-scriptblock> compares the YEAR property of each date. The
<action-scriptblock> displays a welcome message or the number of days until
the beginning of the year 2022.

    switch ((Get-Date 1-Jan-2022), (Get-Date 25-Dec-2021)) {
        { $_.Year -eq 2021 }
            {
                $days = ((Get-Date 1/1/2022) - $_).Days
                "There are $days days until 2022."
            }
        { $_.Year -eq 2022 } { 'Welcome to 2022!' }
    }

If the value matches multiple conditions, the action for each condition is
executed. To change this behavior, use the break or continue keywords.

The break keyword stops processing and exits the switch statement.

The continue keyword stops processing the current value, but continues
processing any subsequent values.

The following example processes an array of numbers and displays if they're
odd or even. Negative numbers are skipped with the continue keyword. If a
non-number is encountered, execution is terminated with the break keyword.

    switch (1,4,-1,3,"Hello",2,1) {
        {$_ -lt 0}           { continue }
        {$_ -isnot [int32]}  { break }
        {$_ % 2}             { "$_ is Odd" }
        {-not ($_ % 2)}      { "$_ is Even" }
    }

    1 is Odd
    4 is Even
    3 is Odd


File parameter examples

Using the switch statement with the FILE parameter is an efficient way to
process large files line by line. PowerShell streams the lines of the file
to the switch statement. Each line is processed individually.

You can terminate the processing before reaching the end of the file by
using the break keyword in the action statement. The switch statement is
more efficient than using Get-Content to process large files line by line.

You can combine switch -File with -Wildcard or -Regex for flexible and
efficient line-by-line pattern matching.

The following example reads the README.md in the PowerShell-Docs
repository. It outputs each line until it reaches the line that starts with
##.

    switch -Regex -File .\README.md {
        '^##\s' { break }
        default { $_; continue }
    }

The <filename> argument is interpreted as a wildcard expression, but it
must match only one file. The following example is the same as the previous
one except it uses a wildcard in the <filename> argument. This example
works because the wildcard pattern matches only one file.

    switch -Regex -File .\README.* {
        '^##\s' { break }
        default { $_; continue }
    }

You must escape characters that can be interpreted as wildcards if you want
them to be treated as literals.

    $file = (New-Item -Path 'Temp:\Foo[0]' -Value Foo -Force).FullName
    switch -File $file { Foo { 'Foo' } }
    # No files matching '...\Temp\Foo[0]' were found.

    $fileEscaped = [WildcardPattern]::Escape($file)
    switch -File $fileEscaped { foo { 'Foo' } }
    # Foo
